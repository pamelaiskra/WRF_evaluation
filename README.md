# Weater Research and Forecasting model
Codes to evaluate outputs of WRF, plus an updated manual on how to run a simulation from scratch

Tasks performed by the codes:

Read NetCDF files, choose relevant layer RAINNC layer (rainfall from non-convective scheme = microphysics)

Calculates, for every 48-hour simulation (9 simulations)
-Probability of Detection
-False Alarm Ratio
-Critical Success Index
-RMSE
-Mean Bias Error
